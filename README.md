# MiniTwit

Because writing todo lists is not fun

# What is MiniTwit?

A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone

# How do I use it?

1. install flask and flask-cli via pip
2. edit the configuration in the minitwit.py file 
  * export the environment variable `MINITWIT_SETTINGS` pointing to a configuration file.
3. Initialize the database by running:

```console
export FLASK_APP=minitwit.py; \
export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8; \
export LANG=en_US.utf-8; \
flask initdb
```

4. Now you can run `minitwit`:

```console
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --with-threads --no-debugger --no-reload
```

The application will greet you on:

```
